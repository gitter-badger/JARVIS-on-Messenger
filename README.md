Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, now on Messenger!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger)

Messenger is now used by 900 million people every month. With the launch of Send / Receive API, bots are about to [take](http://time.com/4291214/facebook-messenger-bots/) [over](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3055588/social-media/an-army-of-chatbots-will-take-over-facebook-here-s-why.html).

### Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).
2. Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier in the world of open source.

Take a look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how easy it is to add your code. I'll be waiting for your pull request! :wink:
